Independent-eQTLs
=================

My slides from the August 14th lab meeting can be found in `LabMeeting8-14.pdf`.

## Data ##
Sample data is located in the `data` directory. This data is dummy example data adapted from Matrix eQTL's sample data. This dummy data is only meant for getting a sense of the format and not for running any test analysis. For real data, you can use the attachments on my page in the lab wiki which is data from the DGN cohort.
